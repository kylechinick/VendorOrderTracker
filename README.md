## Description

This app allows serves as a vendor and order management system for a fictional store, Pierre's Bakery.

Once loaded the user will land on a simple splash page with options to view or add vendors to the system. Choosing to add a vendor serves the user a new-vendor form which, once submitted, saves the vendor data and redirects the user to the homepage.

Viewing the list of vendors will display all saved vendors â€“ the names of each vendor can be clicked to be taken to a vendor-detail page that displays the vendor name, description and all associated orders. Users can also add orders to a vendor from this page via a new-order link which, in a similar manner to the new vendor creation process, takes the user to an order form where they can enter and save their order to the vendor.
